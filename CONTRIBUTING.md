## Feel Free

If anyone would like to add a solution, I would simply ask that it passes the cases on the kattis website. Otherwise, feel free. If the problem is already here, just add your file to that folder, with a name representing that it is an alternate solution.

## Code Requests
Please:

1. Include solution number in your file name (For example: carrots_alt_1.py, carrots_alt_2.py)
1. Keep problem folders organized by difficulty
